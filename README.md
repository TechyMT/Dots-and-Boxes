# Dots and Boxes Game

## Introduction
Dots and Boxes is a classic pen-and-paper game where two players take turns connecting adjacent dots on a grid. The goal is to create as many boxes as possible by completing the fourth side of a square. Each completed box awards the player with a point, and the player with the highest number of points at the end wins the game.

This GitHub project is an implementation of the Dots and Boxes game using the Qt Creator framework. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to play the game against another human player.

## Features
- Interactive GUI for a visually appealing gaming experience.
- Two-player gameplay mode for competitive matches.
- Automatic detection of completed boxes and awarding points to the respective player.
- Real-time score tracking during gameplay.
- Game restart option to play multiple rounds without closing the application.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions for playing the game.

## Technologies Used
- Qt Creator: A cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for creating Qt-based applications.
- C++: The programming language used to develop the game logic and user interface.
- Qt Widgets: The GUI framework provided by Qt Creator for creating interactive user interfaces.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: The game's code is structured using OOP concepts for modularity and reusability.
